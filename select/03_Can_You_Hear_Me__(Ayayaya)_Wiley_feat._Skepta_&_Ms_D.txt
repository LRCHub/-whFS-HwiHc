I was on a path to the limelight
Now I'm on another one it's a night flight
When they say, "I'm a star I say, thank you"
It's all due to the scenes that I ran through
So I keep flyin' the flags for all people
No messin' about we're all equal
Vibe alive in the club when I roll in
I get around with the crowd when I'm roamin'

Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya

Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya

They should know I bring vibes on a club night
Keep the crowd hyped up with the party red
She wanna say words in my earlobe
Reminds me there's an hour of the party left

See the fireworks, celebration, team winnin' the Grey Goose amazin'
Send them Jägerbombs, I got a cravin'
So many women I don't wanna stop ravin'

They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there see the mandem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she's gonna hang with me

I'm skankin' all round the party I'm skankin'
I got girls to the left and girls to the right
When we're at the bar we ain't rampin'

Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya

Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya

Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya

Wiley called me on the iPhone
He said, "Get my passport, told me to come through
Put your sun cream in your suitcase"
When I arrive I'm causin' a heatwave too

Got my snapback and my vest on
Lookin' at the hot girl with the red dress on
Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim so I had to get my Kanye West on

She told me, "She's feelin' my jewellery"
She said, "That she's in love with my Jesus piece"
I told her to, "Look again closely
It's not Jesus, baby, it's Jme"

And I was like, "Baby, come over
I don't bite girl, come a little closer
Come a little closer
I don't bite girl, come a little clo-"

Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya

You know I don't usually party
But Skepta and Wiley said, "It's a hype"
I can't find my phone or my car keys
Like Zippy Tafari said on the mic

The vibe is off the Richter
And I can't even tweet a picture
I'm on the dance floor, the joke is
I never had a drink but I'm actin' the drunkest

She's starin' like I'm a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I'm not supposed to be here though
Haven't got a wrist band for the VIP

No triple A pass
But I'm partyin' with the stars
Yep, I can't complain
I just enjoy while it lasts

Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya

Everybody right now, can you hear me?
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayayaya, ayayaya
Ayayaya, ayayaya
